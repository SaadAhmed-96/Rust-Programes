fn main () {



// Q#1:
// Write a rust program and define a user defined function that receives one argument of
// any suitable data type and print whether the number is positive, negative or equal to zero.
// (hint: if/else)


// Q#2:
// Write a rust program and define a user defined function that receives 4 arguments of
// different data types (integer, float, boolean, string) and print them on the console.


// Q#3:
// Write a rust program and define a user defined function that receives a number and
// return the number itself and its square by using tuple.

// Q#4:
// Write a program to know the result of the test (Pass/Fail) by using a user defined
// function, and perform the following operations: (Note: Consider marks of only 2 subjects for
// the sake of simplicity. Maximum marks are 100 for each subject.)

// a. Add marks and print the total.
// b. Calculate the percentage and print it, return percentage to main function
// c. If percentage >= 70, Print Pass, Else, print Fail.
